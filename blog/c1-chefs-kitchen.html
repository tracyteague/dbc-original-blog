      When I was first applying to these “bootcamp”-style programs, each program discussed its emphasis on a specific language, overall curriculum, job statistics, etc. However, I remember immediately being drawn to DBC for two main reasons: first, DBC was the only program that stressed emotional intelligence and (truly) promoted the well-being of students (e.g., through Yoga) (side note: I have a Psychology background, and absolutely what you would think of as a “Psychology” mindset); and second, I noticed the true emphasis on teamwork, with the idea that we’re in this experiment and “we’re all in this together”.
    </p>
    <p>
      After watching Shereef’s chat, my initial impression of, excitement about, and enthusiasm for DBC and its values hasn’t changed. In regards to the environment, I feel even more excited to be part of an “organization” that promotes such passion, hunger and commitment to learning, and to - seriously - be surrounded by nice people. When Shereef was talking about his first day hosting DBC - with opening the boxes and setting up the Ikea tables while students were walking in - I just had a sense that he (and all those at DBC) are so genuine, so creative and so committed.
    </p>
    <p>
       I liked how Shereef used the “restaurant” vs. “kitchen” mindset analogy. I definitely think each person has both the restaurant mindset and kitchen mindset at different times, but I do think it is a lot about how you perceive a situation and what you make of it. Yes, we’re all responsible for our own learning and experience, it is what we make of it and it is not some packaged deal; and yes, realistically, we are going to have days when we’re feeling off, when we need to be alone, or when something just isn’t sinking in (let’s hope not too many of those). It’s also important to realize that there are some “cooks” with more experience and some with less, but again, we’re all in this together.
    </p>
<p>
     I can’t lie and say that I’m not at all nervous about this program. Shereef talked about the two main fears: essentially, one being too much of a novice, while the other too much of an expert. I definitely do NOT have the fear of being too bored/too ahead as this is all very new to me, but I’m not the most nervous about falling behind. I mean, I know from my prep work that there have been times that I’ve spent two hours on one piece of code that should have only taken one minute, but I also try to be patient and realize these roadblocks happen.
     </p>
<p>
So what am I most nervous for? First, I’m honestly a bit nervous about the environment. I’ve read about how this program experience really depends not only on your commitment, but on your cohort’s commitment, and how everyone interacts. I’m am absolutely positive that those in my cohort are nice, fun, and intelligent people - so I don’t mean it to sound like that - but there is a fear that maybe our dynamic won’t “click”.
</p>
<p>
Second, I’m nervous about - and currently working on - time management. I mean, I thought I had it down with figuring out a schedule that works for me, but I’ve realized with DBC reflections and exercises, it’s a different road. Even now, I put a timer on my phone to stop me from working on this for more than an hour and 15 minutes…and it just went off. This is definitely something I realize that I want to work on before getting into Phase 1 as I feel like I could potentially be the person who goes down the rabbit hole too often when getting excited about a project. I guess I’ll be investing in a tomato sometime soon.
</p>
<p>
Third, I’m nervous for life after graduation. I don’t necessarily mean just finding a job (I mean, of course I’m worried about spending X number of dollars on a program while having no income, and then paying rent, bills, food, etc.), but more-so, my well-being and my psyche. Going from being around a group of people, for 10 hours+ a day, 6-7 days a week, working non-stop, to literally having nothing on my plate, so much free time, and just searching for jobs - that’s a lot all at once. I’m a bit scared to for the sense of feeling lost. At least, I do realize that, post-DBC, you still do have your support system from your cohort and teachers (in addition to family and friends), which I’m very thankful for. For now though….I think I’ll focus on the good, because Phase 1 hasn’t even started!
</p>
<p>
In sum, I guess all I can say is I’m a mix of emotions between nervous and excited, but I’m so ready to take on this experiment and join this crazy train for the next 5 months!
