  <h2>Version Control, git, and Github</h2>

      And so it begins! A discussion on version control, git, and Github from one newbie to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version Control: Version control is basically maintaining the original copy of a file while tracking new changes (i.e., how you would think of using "Track Changes" in Microsoft Word). Essentially, the benefit of using version control is that it allows a team to collaborate from anywhere in the world, at any time, on one project - with greater productivity and less confusion. Version control provides the ability for each collaborator to work on the most up-to-date version of a project. Further, as every change/edit is tracked, the team is able to ultimately decide which changes to use - or merge - into the file (and which to discard). Moreover, if certain changes that were implemented don't seem to work out, the team will always have the original version of the file (version control!) to fall back on.

      How do we use version control? With git!
    </p>
    <p>
      Git: Git is the software that you install onto your computer that tracks changes for you when working on a file. It is important to note that git is stored locally on your personal computer - meaning, it is only in your computer's files (i.e., not in the public domain). As discussed above, the original file is always preserved, and new changes are created in separate, new versions (version control!). Although it's great for you to see all of your own files and changes, most often in programming, teams are formed to collaborate on projects (and thus, several files).

    How do we share our changes with our team? With GitHub!

    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub: GitHub is an online tool that allows you to upload your files/directories from your personal computer to allow access to others (note: on GitHub, these files/directories are labeled "repositories"). As git is stored locally on your personal computer, GitHub is stored remotely online. Outsiders (again, from anywhere in the world) can use GitHub to view your work in order to utilize your ideas and/or to provide feedback and suggestions. In a nutshell, GitHub is  an entirely remote, collaborative network!

    I hope that this quick lesson on version control, git and GitHub was simple, clear and informative. Please always feel free to provide any feedback!
