    <h4>“HACKING”: What is it?</h4>

<p>
“Hacking,” defined as “cut with rough or heavy blows”, has been the term coined to refer to the act of “using a computer to gain unauthorized access to data in a system”. Hacking has become a massive problem facing the tech-world in recent years as it seems that anything and everything can be “broken into”. It has led to countless instances of breaching personal data - including leaking private photos from one's iCloud, revealing confidential patient information in electronic health records (EHR), showing unreleased movies and music (sorry, Sony!), and posting (rather creepy) messages on government Twitter accounts. As this phenomenon is so broad and widespread, I’ll focus on one specific issue at-hand that some of us may personally relate to - password hacking.
</p>

<h4>HOW DO THEY DO IT?</h4>

<p>
It’s important to recognize the various ways in which one’s password can be hacked in order to take the proper security measures to protect your information. Below are a couple of basic, hacking “avenues” to remember and the proper precautions you can take:
</p>

<h5>KEYLOGGERS</h5>

<p>
 Keyloggers are malicious pieces of software that can run in the background, logging every key stroke you make, and are often used to capture sensitive data like credit card numbers, online banking passwords, etc. Subsequently, this information is then sent to an “attacker” over the internet.
</p>

<p>
WHAT CAN I DO?: Maintain and use a decent antivirus program, keep all software updated for security measures, and avoid downloading untrustworthy software.
</p>

<h5>SOCIAL ENGINEERING</h5>

<p>
“Phishing” is a common term for social engineering. Essentially, the attacker impersonates someone and asks for your password. We’ve definitely all witnessed the e-mail “from your bank” that asks you to “reauthenticate” your password and subsequently directs you to a fake bank website.
</p>

<p>
WHAT CAN I DO?: BE CAREFUL! Don’t click on links in emails; instead, go to the actual websites (such as your actual bank website).
</p>

<h4>OTHER WAYS TO BE SAFE</h4>

<p>
There’s no real solution for this problem as of yet as it truly seems that anyone’s Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, iCloud, Credit Card information, etc. can easily be hacked into. However, in addition to the above examples, there are some simple precautions that we can each take in order to avoid such issues and hopefully, decrease the overall problem:
</p>

<p>
1. Use UNIQUE passwords for your accounts.<br>
2. Include a VARIETY of characters in your password, including upper case, lower case, numbers, and symbols, when possible.<br>
3. UPDATE your password often.<br>
4. Be smart when choosing your SECURITY QUESTIONS - make sure they cannot be easily guessed!<br>
