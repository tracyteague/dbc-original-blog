      <h4>COMPUTER VS. HUMAN: MEMORY</h4>

        <p>
          Whether you're human or machine, the basic purpose of memory is to keep a record of information for a period of time. As humans, we often forget things - long-term, not remembering what we wore on our first day of Kindergarten, or short-term, forgetting that person's name we just met. Nowadays, it almost seems as if computers have become our second "mind" for storage. We "remember", or save, our information into files and documents, and can edit these "memories" on a daily basis (that is, if we are lucky enough to not experience a devastating computer crash...or epic iPhone fail). So, let's take a quick look into this fascinating world of computer memory in order to get a basic understanding of the two types of memory - namely, main and auxiliary.
        </p>

      <h4>TWO TYPES OF MEMORY: MAIN & AUXILIARY</h4>

        <h5>MAIN (INTERNAL) MEMORY</h5>
          <p>
            Main memory (i.e., internal memory) is built-in and made up of silicon chips (i.e., integrated circuits), and can store and quickly retrieve data (i.e., computerized information). This type of memory it used when helping the computer process whatever it is currently working on.
          </p>
        <h5>RAM & ROM</h5>
          <p>
            The main memory inside a computer is based on two kinds of chips: a temporary, volatile kind that remembers only while the power is on, known as "RAM" (random access memory), and a permanent, nonvolatile kind that remembers whether the power is on and off, konwn as "ROM" (read-only memory). RAM chips remember thing sonly while a computer is powered on, so they are used for storing whatever a compter is woring on in the very short-term. On the other hand, ROM chips remember things whether or not the power is on. They are used to store things like the computer's basic input/output system (known as BIOS) that operates fundamental things like the computer's screen and keyboard.
          </p>
        <h5>AUXILIARY (EXTERNAL) MEMORY</h5>
          <p>
            Auxiliary memory (i.e., storage, or external memory) is used to "remember" things even when the computer's power is disconnected. Auxiliary memory was originally referred to as "external memory" as, "back in the day", this type of memory was typically housed in a completely separate machine connected to the main computer box by a cable.
          </p>
        <h5>EXTERNAL DEVICES</h5>
          <p>
            People have used all kinds of extenral memory devices - most of which stored information by magnetizing things. In the past, one such type of device commonly used was a floppy disk (I know, throwback!) - a small, thin circle of plastic, coated with magnetic material, spinning inside durable plastic cases. Zip drives were similar, but stored much more information in a highly compressed form inside chunky cartridges. Nowadays, modern computers store this information on much smaller devices, such as USB flash memory sticks and plug in hard-drives.
          </p>
    <h4>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <p>
          As the world of computer memory is very extensive (and somewhat complicated!), this was just a very basic, introductory lesson on the two main types of memory.
