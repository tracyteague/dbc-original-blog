    Now that we’re at the end of week 5 in Phase 0 (which is so unreal to me), it’s time for a reflection on pairing and feedback so far…
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to pairing in Phase 0, I have to admit that I had mixed emotions. I like working with others as I genuinely just enjoy interacting and collaborating with people. At the same time, I have often preferred to work on assignments and projects on my own - partially because I wanted to teach myself by learning and researching all of the information, and partially because we all know those times that there was a “slacker” in a group activity during college. What I didn’t think about with that latter part is, well, that was college - where some people didn’t really care or didn’t feel particularly passionate about the subject - and this is DBC - where everyone absolutely and truly does WANT to be, where everyone wants to learn, to help others, to inspire others and be inspired - it’s a whole different realm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, after having over 10 pairing sessions, I both enjoy and always benefit from pairing with my peers. It’s always fun - everyone is enthusiastic by examining different methods or ways to solve the problem. In the majority of my sessions that involved a more creative component, my partner and I would be silly and use a funny theme; for example, we created a method, fast_food_chains, with parameters of fav_food and mascot [Hamburglar FTW]. Even though we’re working on the challenge, it’s always very relaxed in the sense that we’re focusing on the task-at-hand, but enjoying ourselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, everyone is so unbelievably bright and has so much knowledge when it comes to the actual information about Ruby and/or how to approach a problem and communicate the steps. Not only is it rewarding to actually solve the challenge and let out that yelp of excitement (and a big sigh of relief), but to be able to learn from my peers in so many other ways. Although this definitely includes learning additional knowledge about Ruby syntax or little tricks to use in Terminal, the most beneficial to me is watching others as they approach the problem - how they communicate their thoughts, how they express their ideas so clearly and concisely, and how they share with you small ways to be motivated, calm, and to work through frustration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of frustration, I’d say the most frustrating/difficult thing for me has been feeling “bad” during sessions when I feel like I understand the information less than my partner. Sometimes, this is incorrect, and I have a lack of confidence on what I really do know. Other times, this is correct, and I may just have a more difficult time grasping a certain concept and/or my partner may have more experience. Either way, I go into the challenge a bit nervous and almost feeling guilty because I worry I’m going to hold them back or frustrate them with my lack of knowledge. Welp, I really should realize that I need to let go of this sense of “guilt” as my beliefs are not only false, but are probably hindering my experiences in sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My feedback has really opened my eyes to my strength and weaknesses, and personally, has made me feel much more confident and just in general, better with everything going on. I pretty much knew these S&W beforehand, but it’s always more influential when you hear it (or read it) from others. Essentially, I’ve been told how my communication skills are pretty much on point, in the sense that I’m able to communicate clearly what I’m thinking and am not afraid to ask for help or say when I’m lost. As far as technical skills, my feedback has made me realize that I do know a lot more than I realize and that I can perform the research well, however, there are definitely some things I need to work on - such as really reviewing some Ruby hash and class syntax and concepts. Some of the greatest pieces of feedback have involved finding out that people don’t mind (and often like) when I express my confusion. In these situations, my pairs have said it was good that I recognized when I was lost and acknowledged it, and were more than happy to explain the concepts as this also challenged them or helped them to reinforce the concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on my feedback, moving forward, I just need to first become more familiar with concepts that I had difficulty with in Ruby. For the next time I pair on a challenge, if it’s possible, I want to work up to that challenge (or at least, as close as possible) so I have all of the previous knowledge and can be on the same page. Moreover, going in, I’ll just be more confident and less worried about holding someone back. It’s a learning and teaching process!
  </p>
  <p>
    In regards to writing feedback, I like reflecting on the session and sharing with others all of the positive ways I benefitted from during our session (plus, it’s always good to recognize and acknowledge one’s strong points to increase his/her confidence). Thus, the specific and kind components have been easier, while the actionable feedback has been a bit more difficult. In the beginning, I often didn’t know what to write as I felt like my partner was on track, and that we completed the tasks well as a team. More recently, as we’ve been getting into more difficult tasks, I still find it a bit difficult at times, but have noticed some more things during our session that we could have done, such as pseudocoding, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, I think pairing and feedback to guide learning is so, so important - especially in this Phase 0. I know that my pairs and I have discussed the difficulty and frustration in working alone at this point, without instructors or students around (I personally prefer the classroom environment), so pairing with others allows us to not only work through these problems and learn from one another, but to be open about and share these emotions. Additionally, the feedback received will help you to further identify your strength and weaknesses as well as “opens your eyes” to what you can improve on and what you’re doing well. It  also can definitely a confidence-booster as it makes you recognize the positive and not only the negative aspects.
  </p>
  <p>
    This whole experience so far with pairing has been really refreshing - to be around a group of people who are kind, enthusiastic, willing to teach you and to learn, and who want to just have fun with the process. Whenever you struggling, remember that we’re all in this together!
