      We've all experienced several instances of conflict throughout our lives - whether with colleagues, among our family, or in personal relationships. We seem to automatically label our subsequent emotions as simply "angry" or "upset", when really, there are several other underlying feelings that we may be encountering, such as disrespect, frustration, and so forth. It's important to understand the true source and specific emotions that we are experiencing in order to effectively acknowledge, deal with, and resolve our conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I had a conflict with my roommate, who is one of my closest friends. My roommate's family lives in another country, so when her family members visit, they stay with us (note: keep in mind, my apartment is a super, super, tiny, typical box-sized flex 2-bedroom in NYC). I was aware that her parent would be staying for approximately two weeks, two times a year, and was perfectly fine with the situation as, obviously, I wanted to be more than welcoming to anyone's family member. This past spring, due to unforseen issues outside of anyone's control, my roommate's parent was at our apartment longer than planned, and without a set-date to return home. Tension grew between us during this period; we didn't speak as much, we didn't hang out, I avoided being in the apartment, and we both avoided discussing the situation and continued to brush it "under the rug".
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a lot of (what seemed like) anger at the time, mostly because I was so conflicted about how I was feeling about this conflict! I felt frustrated, because I didn't know how to address or deal with the situation, but I think ultimately, I felt guilty about my own emotions. I felt guilty that I felt such a way about a situation involving someone's family member; that I possibly created this tension when I should have been more accepting of the circumstances; that I obviously couldn't hide my frustration and awkwardness. I didn't know how to deal with it, so I avoided the situation until I no longer could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the family member's stay, I spoke to my parents to "vent" out the issue, rather than speaking to my roommate directly about how I felt. It wasn't until a few weeks after her family member left that we hit a "breaking point" and ended up talking about the situation. It still took a few weeks and a couple of small acknowledgments to get fully comfortable with one another again, but thankfully, our friendship was back-to-normal and we are now better than ever.
    <p>
      Obviously, if I could go back, I would have expressed what I was feeling from the start in order to promote an open, comfortable environment, and to avoid any awkward tension or damage to a relationship. I definitely realize that I have a bit of an avoidant personality when it comes to conflict, or even with completing certain tasks. However, I have been really trying to change this aspect about me by being proactive and dealing with conflict from the start in order to prevent another instance of this situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any takeaway message from this blog, please always be sure to address conflict from the start. First, examine the true source of the conflict; second, understand the underlying emotions that you are truly experiencing; and third, address the person or situation in order to stop the subsequent tension and to prevent any permanent damage. It's not worth it!
