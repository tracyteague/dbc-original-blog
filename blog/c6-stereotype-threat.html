      One of the many (emphasize, many!) reasons I am so glad that I chose to apply for and attend Dev Bootcamp is because of its emphasis on empathy. I may be somewhat biased with my Psychology background, but I truly do believe that it is so important to truly understand what it feels like “to be in someone else's shoes” - whether it be within a close, personal friendship, or in a more formal work-colleague relationship. Going along with this emphasis on empathy, it will be important for us at DBC to be aware of our surroundings and the feelings of our peers in order to avoid instances of “stereotype threat”.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stereotype threat” refers to “the threat of being viewed through the lens of negative stereotype, or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype”. Essentially, it is “subconscious self-handicapping”. As a little bit of background information on how it affects performance, recent research has shown that stereotype threat can cognitively affect the individual by reducing his or her working memory resources, therefore, ultimately undermining his or her ability to successfully complete intellectual tasks. Although this phenomenon is mostly discussed in terms of academics, it has been shown to affect the stereotyped individuals’ performance in a number of domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      A specific group-situation that seems to be cited often involves females in mathematical or technological fields. I have heard - and seen - these stereotypes as it was often suggested that careers in these industries are more innately “suited” or “appropriate” for males. Despite the amazing strides that businesses, programs (such as DBC), and people, in general, have made to remove this belief, it is still widely existent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, I don’t believe that I have ever really experienced stereotype threat. Before starting DBC, I had not been in a “male-dominated” field as I studied Psychology and was surrounded by mostly females. It wasn’t until very recently that I began programming on my own and, during this period, I have not been personally affected by such verbal stereotyping. Sure, I’ve heard over-and-over again how so few females are in this field and how it is mostly men - but I don’t think of it as intimidating - I view it as empowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite my feelings of empowerment (and excitement!), I can understand how others may feel a bit nervous or fearful. If I come to suspect or notice that one of my peers is experiencing emotions related to stereotype threat - whether female or male - I’ll absolutely do whatever I can to be encouraging and welcoming in order to reduce such negative feelings. It’s important to emphasize one another’s skills, values, and goals, and to highlight each other’s triumphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our program specifically, we should remind one another that whenever we are struggling and experience feelings of incompetency, to take a step back and remember that we all were able to get into such a selective program, because or our abilities, our enthusiasm, and our drive. Moreover, we should emphasize that intelligence is not fixed, but, rather, always evolving, and that this principal applies to all individuals outside the context of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and so on. Intelligence, as suggested in the concept of a “growth mindset”, is something that can be developed/changed over context and/or time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to always be mindful about what we say, as we may be not fully aware of the sensitivity of others. Specific to DBC, it will be important that we all provide constructive, meaningful, and kind feedback, using DBC’s standards to A.S.K. (Actionable, Specific, Kind). Such effective feedback will increase confidence, as it assures each of our peers that he or she is capable of meeting the high standards of this program and that his or her abilities and “belonging” are assumed rather than questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As stereotype threat is not something that can go away overnight, I do hope that it becomes an issue that is more openly discussed. If a situation arises in which I see another person treating one of my peers in a stereotypical manner, or if I notice someone struggling with a concept and expressing such concerns related to this topic, I will do my best to approach the situation in a sensitive manner in order to reassure and encourage my fellow peer. In every aspect of my life, I genuinely care about the well-being of those around me, and I already know I care deeply about the well-being of my new DBC family.
