Who would believe that we are already at the end of Phase 0, Unit 1…and how much we have learned, not just technically, but, moreover, personally - about what works for us, what doesn’t and what we need to improve.
</p>
<p>
As I found out before starting Phase 0, my results for the "thinking style" quiz revealed that I am mainly an "Abstract Random Thinker”. I remember thinking that this is definitely “spot-on” as it goes right along with my degree, interest and passion for Psychology. In the description of an AR thinker, it has been said that this type of “learner” likes to listen to others, bring harmony in group situations and establish healthy relationships with others. Further, he or she learns best when in a personalized environment, when able to maintain friendly relationships and when able to participate in group activities.
</p>
<p>
I definitely believe that these aspects fully apply to the way I think (and my personality, in general)! I prefer to be in a people-oriented environment and work around others. I know that a big part of DBC is establishing this “support system” and assisting one another on a daily basis, so it will even more beneficial for my learning experience and understanding when I am with everyone in-person!
</p>
<p>
As one would think, AR thinkers find it hard to learn in a more restrictive environment and, moreover, to concentrate on one thing at a time. I’ve noticed throughout Phase 0 that these have been some of my biggest struggles so far at DBC. In terms of the way I learn, some of my greatest struggles have been learning on my own with time management and organization, as I often move from one challenge or release to another because I am unable to concentrate when I come across a “roadblock” (e.g., when I can’t figure out a code in a Ruby example). I’ll move onto something else and come back to the example later - which sometimes can be to my benefit, as I’ll then understand the code, but other times, can lead to more confusion and frustration as I either forget or am unaware of what exactly I still need to complete. These instances also occur due to the breaks “in flow” when I have to leave for work in the middle of a challenge or release.
</p>
<p>
Also relating to time management, I’ve noticed that I often spend too much time on one challenge or release without even realizing it! This has happened in all types of exercises - whether spending too much time on a blog (like this) so that I get all of my thoughts written down, or spending too much time trying to figure out one problem in Ruby when I find out the solution was just a minor change in syntax!
</p>
<p>
Over these past weeks, I’ve realized that I do my best when I devote an entire day at a time to complete a set amount of challenges. In doing so, I am more productive as I establish a flow from one challenge to another and am able to more easily grasp the concepts. Moving forward, until February 23rd, I’ve figured out how I will keep this pattern and have blocked off certain days strictly for DBC. Furthermore, this past week 3, I’ve really been employing the 25-5 technique and have been using mootsi - which has been a massive time-saver.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, it is hard for these types of thinkers to give exact details. I actually have seen this struggle throughout pairing sessions in finding a way to verbalize what I am thinking. Moving forward, this ability is something I will hopefully acquire with practice, but I know now that each time I need to fully prepare for a pairing session by successfully completing and truly understanding the previous challenges.
</p>
<p>
As we learned in the prephase 0 coursework, a  "fixed mindset" embodies a deterministic view of the world as it holds onto the notion that one's intelligence, character, and creativity are all "static". On the other hand, a ”growth mindset" gives one a greater sense of free will as it holds onto the notion that one's intelligence can be developed.Those with a "growth mindset" embrace challenges, take on obstacles, persist throughout setbacks, and decide to learn from others' critiques in order to ultimately reach higher levels of achievement.
</p>
<p>
For me to think and learn effectively in Phase 0 (and all of DBC), I need to remind myself to look at these challenges and the subsequent frustration in a more positive light in realizing that I am “bettering” myself and pushing myself to find new ways to think so that I can learn in any environment. I know that I really do need to reach out to others more for help to assist me in understanding the concepts - whether it be through office hours or from fellow DBC peers. I have used the Google+ community which has been amazing (thank you, all!), but I should definitely be utilizing this and other resources more throughout this program. In doing so, I’ll not only save so much time, but I’ll also be more likely to really understand the information and to establish relationships and a sense of community along the way!
