      When reviewing my overall pattern, it turns out that most of my core values relate to a sense of being challenged, expressing compassion, and maintaining close relationships. In exploring my values, I encounter a variety of emotions. When I think about challenge and adventure, I get excited; meaningful work, commitment, and self-respect, I feel empowered; affection, romance, friendship, and close relationships, I’m happy (and somewhat nostalgic)!
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s always been said that you can hold endless knowledge, money, or power, but “life” is truly meaningless without having love, affection, and close relationships. This may be a bit of a cliché, but for me, it’s 100% true. In close relationships, I hold so many other values, including compassion, empathy, openness, affection, commitment, community, honesty…I think you catch my drift! Any object or materialistic item could never compare to the bond that forms between one being and another, with the ability to transform someone’s life on a daily basis – often, without even realizing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last topic someone asked me advice on actually had to do with relationships. One of my closest friends felt hurt within one of her own close relationships, as she felt that she was being spoken “down” to in a condescending, passive-aggressive manner.  In addressing this issue, acknowledging my own friend’s pain, and sharing advice, it not only reiterated the importance of compassion, empathy, and friendship, but also reminded me of the need to be open and honest with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these types of situations, people will often avoid discussing such feelings as they may think they are “overreacting” or “being too sensitive”. However, this approach is problematic for both the relationship – causing undesirable tension – as well as the individual – inflicting damaging emotional discomfort. If it is a “true” friendship or close relationship, both parties will want to promote and accept openness and freedom of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      These values of openness and freedom of judgment – in addition many others already noted - will help me mediate stereotype threat if and when I either personally experience it or notice such from one of my peers during DBC (or in the workforce). I can remind myself and others of why we have decided to pursue programming – for a challenge, for adventure, to find meaningful work – as well as of our accomplishments – of all of the times we have been challenged by others or challenged ourselves, and succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the prospect of experiencing stereotype threat, it is likely that each of us will feel down at some point while we’re attending DBC – whether related to stress, personal issues or simply exhaustion. One coping mechanism that I’ve used to alleviate negative emotions is to perform a very simple journaling exercise. Take five-to-ten minutes to jot down what’s running through your head – it can be full sentences or “gibberish” – on your phone, computer or in a notebook. After doing so, take a minute to breath, reflect, and then spend another five-to-ten minutes writing down what made/is going to make you happy today – anything from a delicious iced coffee you’ve been craving, to a favorite song you just listened to. Sometimes, we need to be reminded of the simple things in life to realize how thankful and lucky we truly are!
